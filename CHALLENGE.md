**Challenge Title:** TODO Application

**Challenge Description:**

Welcome to the TODO Application Code Challenge! In this challenge, you will be developing an application that allows users to create and categorize TODOs. This application will consist of both a frontend and a backend component.

**Challenge Requirements:**

1. **Frontend**: Implement a frontend application using any frontend technology of your choice (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular) that provides the following functionality:

   - Users can view a list of TODO items.
   - Users can add a new TODO item with a title, description, and category.
   - Users can edit existing TODO items (title, description, category).
   - Users can mark TODO items as completed or incomplete.
   - Users can filter TODO items by category.
   - Users can delete TODO items.

2. **Backend**: Implement a backend API that supports the frontend application. The backend should provide endpoints for the following operations:

   - Create a new TODO item.
   - Retrieve a list of TODO items.
   - Update an existing TODO item.
   - Mark a TODO item as completed or incomplete.
   - Delete a TODO item.

3. **Bonus Points:**

   - Implement user authentication to secure the application.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, Heroku).
   - Write unit and/or interaction tests to ensure the reliability of your application.

**Submission Instructions:**

- Submit all your code to this repo, and send a .zip with your code to our email.
- Include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to set up and run your application.
- Candidates should submit the repository link along with any additional notes about their design choices and whether they have implemented any of the bonus points.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Candidates will be evaluated based on their ability to create a functional project management application adhering to a 3-layer architecture and the MVC pattern. Evaluation criteria include design, usability, adherence to the provided requirements, and bonus point achievements.
